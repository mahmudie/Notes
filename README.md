## [Project 1:  Afghanistan’s Nutrition Data Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOTI2ODY3M2YtNTQ2My00YTY0LThlMGUtZTYyMzI4N2RkNzEzIiwidCI6IjExYjJhMTMyLTI2YzYtNDJjNy05N2IxLWVlNGY2YTU2NjNlYiIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D)

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing nutrition data to improve performance and enhance decision-making within UNICEF Afghanistan’s nutrition section. It can serve as a one-stop-shop for using nutrition data produced by UNICEF support as well as other stakeholders. 

The initiative makes use of data from 12 different data sources, online platforms, and user submissions. It is built on a BI solution that allows data to be imported/refreshed regularly from source systems into a consolidated repository. SSIS and Python are commonly used to extract, transform, and load data.
